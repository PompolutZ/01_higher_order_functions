## Higher Order functions

This repository contains code examples used in the [video: Higher Order Functions. Part 1](https://youtu.be/3nJtbRdeR8g)

Each example gives you an opportunity to experiment yourself,
providing unfinished examples with instructions what should be fixed.

Solutions can be found in files, with `.solution` postfix.

NOTE: In the video I use [bun](https://bun.sh/docs), but if you run from stackblitz's terminal you should use nodejs, e.g.:

```
node 01.solution.js
```
